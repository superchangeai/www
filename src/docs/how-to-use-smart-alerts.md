The [smart alerts page](https://www.superchange.ai/alerts) lets you manage one of the primary actions offered by Superchange: getting notifications at your own schedule.

You will never miss the news when something breaks, improves, or launches!

## What is this for?
- Get notified when your stack changes: breaking updates, new features, deprecations, you name it!
- Filter, sort, and manage all your existing alerts in one place
