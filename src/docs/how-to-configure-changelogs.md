The [Changelog Settings page](https://www.superchange.ai/settings/changelogs) is your control panel for custom feeds.

It’s where members create focused changelogs, tweak the ones they’ve already made, or share them with others.

<hr>

## What is this for?
- Spin up a dedicated changelog for your team, project, or workflow
- Keep things clean: track only the providers you care about
- Share public links to your curated view of the tech stack

<hr>

## What you can do
### Members only ([Login here](https://www.superchange.ai/login))
1. Click the ➕ button to create a new changelog:
   - Name it anything
   - Pick providers to include
2. Use the dropdown menu on each existing changelog to:
   - **Edit**: add/remove providers, rename the changelog
   - **Share**: toggle a public URL for easy sharing
   - **Delete**: remove it permanently (no undo)

Want to see your custom changelog in action? Head back to the [feed](https://superchange.ai/feed/) and switch to it from the top dropdown.
