Set up a dedicated email channel so Superchange can send alerts directly to your inbox. You choose the frequency. We make sure it’s yours.

Start here: [Set up a channel](https://www.superchange.ai/settings/channels/new)

<hr>

## What is this for?
- Push Superchange alerts to an email you control
- Route updates to teammates, stakeholders
- Control frequency: daily, weekly, or “firehose”

<hr>

## What you can do
### Members only ([Login here](https://www.superchange.ai/login))
1. Add any valid email address as a new channel
2. Configure optional fields like `Cc:` (comma-separated) and a custom subject line (we’ll still prefix with `[Superchange.ai]`)
3. Pick your delivery style:
   - **Weekly Digest**: One roundup every week
   - **Daily Push**: Consolidated daily update
   - **Firehose**: Instant delivery, every time something changes
4. Verify ownership via a one-time email — look for *“Confirm your email”* from `team@contact.superchange.ai`

ℹ️ Already verified this email before? Skip the reconfirmation — we remember

> Pro tip: the same email can subscribe to both daily and weekly digests. No conflicts.
