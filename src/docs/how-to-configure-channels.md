Head to your [Channels settings](https://www.superchange.ai/settings/channels) to tell Superchange where and when to send alerts. Right now, that means email — but Slack and Webhook support are coming next.

<hr>

## What is this for?
- See which channels are set up to receive smart alerts
- Control how often you get them (daily, weekly, or right away)
- Customize the recipient, CC list, and subject line
- Delete channels you no longer need

> **Heads-up:** We have set up a default channel (preconfigured at weekly frequency using your Superchange account email)

<hr>

## What you can do

### Members only ([Login here](https://www.superchange.ai/login))

1. View all your active email channels.
2. Click the ➕ button to [add a new one](/settings/channels/new)
3. Configure:
   - The destination email (`To`)
   - The CC list
   - The subject line
   - The delivery frequency (daily, weekly, or firehose)
4. Delete any channel (this will also remove related alerts)

> **Notes:** 
- Changing the main “To” email will require re-verification.
- Deleting a channel also deletes the alerts tied to it.
