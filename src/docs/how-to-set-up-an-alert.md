Set up tailored alerts so you never miss an update that matters. Smart alerts mean fewer surprises—and no more sifting through changelogs you don’t care about.

Start setting yours up here: [Create an alert](https://www.superchange.ai/alerts/new)

## What is this for?
- Get updates from the providers you care about  
- Choose which types of changes get delivered (Breaking, New Features, etc.)  
- Control when and how often

   - Missing something? [Request a provider](https://www.superchange.ai/providers/all#more)  
2. **Choose update types**: Narrow down for what you can't miss.
3. **Select a channel**:  
   - Alerts go out via **email** (for now*).  
   - An email channel was already created for the address tied to your account. It was set a weekly frequency by default.
   - You can configure your email channels in [Settings → Channels](https://www.superchange.ai/settings/channels)
