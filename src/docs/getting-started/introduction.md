Welcome to Superchange.ai. Your free, open-source monitoring tool for tracking and managing changes from all the tech providers you depend on. 

## Why Superchange ?

Modern software projects depend on so many API providers like OpenAI, OSS like Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, and countless others. Yet they move so fast it becomes impossible to stay in sync, plan, build, or maintain.

Panic attack with legacy specs. Death by breaking changes. This pain has accelerated dramatically with the insane AI lifecycles â€“ things move faster than what one can monitor manually.

Wait a minute: chaotic, unstructured data are digested by LLMs in no time. AI can assist us with scraping, storing, classifying, and alerting our teams on the providers we care about.

So, Superchange.ai was born.

## What is Superchange.ai?

Superchange.ai automatically aggregates changelogs from various tech providers into one central feed, making it easy to stay updated on the latest changes and updates. 

Superchange helps you filter, organize, and receive alerts about the changes that matter most to you.

Superchange is MIT-licensed, free for all.
