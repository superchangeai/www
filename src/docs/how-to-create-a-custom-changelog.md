The [Create Changelog page](https://www.superchange.ai/changelogs/new) lets you spin up a personalized feed of updates for just the providers you care about.

Use it to slice through the noise. Curate as many focused feeds as you need.

## What is this for?
- Build a dedicated changelog that only includes your selected providers
- Group providers by project, team, or function
- Keep stakeholders aligned with relevant updates—nothing more, nothing less

## What you can do
### Members only ([Login here](https://www.superchange.ai/login))

Go to [Create a changelog](https://www.superchange.ai/changelogs/new)

1. Pick a name for your changelog (e.g. “AI Stack” or “Team Front-end”)
2. Browse by category to find your providers. Use “Select all” or “Clear selection” at the bottom for bulk actions!
3. Save. Your new changelog starts tracking updates from just those providers.

💡 Can’t find a provider you need? You can [request new](https://www.superchange.ai/providers/all#more) ones directly in the app. We're always adding more based on user demand.

Next: [Share your changelog](https://www.superchange.ai/settings/changelogs) with your team or the world.
